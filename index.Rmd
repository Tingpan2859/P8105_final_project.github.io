## Where to find fantastic eats?

It is hard for anyone to find a good restaurant, no matter if they stay in the same place for a long time or just move in like us. When people do not know where to eat, rating apps such as yelp would be a key resource for people to use. However, it led to an interesting question to us: what factors could correlate with rates or stars.  

To answer the questions, we studied open data of Restaurants in Southeastern Pennsylvania from **Yelp open dataset** ([data source](Report.html)).  
<span style="font-size: 18pt; color: red;">7,801 Restaurants</span>
<span style="font-size: 15pt; color: orange;">227 cities</span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt; color: lightblue;">6 counties</span>

## Where are the Restaurants  
Upon data analysis, we condensed the restaurants information across different locations and categories in the Southeastern Pennsylvania, analyzing the distribution of restaurants in the Pennsylvania.  

```{r heatmap_data, include=FALSE}
county <- read_csv("data/PA-city-county.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Summarize restaurant counts by zip and include city
zip_restaurant_counts <- mergedPA %>%
  group_by(postal_code, city) %>%
  summarize(restaurant_count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(postal_code = as.character(postal_code)) 

# PA was only available in 2010 version
pa_zipcodes <- suppressMessages({zctas(state = "PA", class = "sf", year = 2010)}) %>%
  mutate(ZCTA5CE10 = as.character(ZCTA5CE10))  

# county boundaries
pa_counties <- counties(state = "PA", class = "sf") %>%
  filter(NAME %in% c("Montgomery", "Delaware", "Chester", "Bucks", "Berks", "Philadelphia"))


filtered_zipcodes <- pa_zipcodes %>%
  semi_join(zip_restaurant_counts, by = c("ZCTA5CE10" = "postal_code"))

# Join restaurant data with the filtered zip
pa_zipcodes_restaurants <- filtered_zipcodes %>%
  left_join(zip_restaurant_counts, by = c("ZCTA5CE10" = "postal_code"))


```

```{r limitded_zip, fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.8, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
zipcode_heatmap <- ggplot(data = pa_zipcodes_restaurants) +
  geom_sf(
    aes(
      fill = restaurant_count,
      text = paste0(
        "ZIP Code: ", ZCTA5CE10,
        "\nCity: ", city,
        "\nRestaurant Count: ", restaurant_count
      )
    ),
    color = "grey10",  
    , linewidth = 0.1      
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = pa_counties,
    fill = NA, 
    color = "blue",    
    linetype = "dashed", 
    size = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_sf_text(data = pa_counties, aes(label = NAME), 
               size = 4, 
               fontface = "bold", 
               color = "#333333") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors = c("#ffe2df", "#FFADAD", "#FF6F61", "#ff5252", "#a70000"), 
    na.value = "grey90",  
    name = "Restaurant Count"
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(-76, -74.7),  
    ylim = c(39.7, 40.6),  
    expand = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Restaurants by ZIP Code in Southeastern Pennsylvania",
    fill = "Restaurant Count"
  )

# Convert the ggplot to a Plotly object
zipcode_heatmap_plotly <- ggplotly(zipcode_heatmap, tooltip = "text")
zipcode_heatmap_plotly

```


## Restaurant Around Southeastern PA
The map shows that most restaurants in Southeastern Pennsylvania are clustered around Philadelphia, reflecting its status as a densely populated urban center. The majority of ratings are green, indicating an average star rating around 4. Suburban counties like Montgomery and Bucks also have notable restaurant density, but their distribution is more spread out compared to the concentrated clusters in Philadelphia.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pa_counties, color = "black", fill = "lightgrey", size = 0.8) + 
  geom_point(
    data = mergedPA,
    aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = stars),
    size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5
  ) +  
  geom_sf_text(
    data = pa_counties,
    aes(label = NAME),
    size = 3, color = "black", fontface = "bold"
  ) +  
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-76, -74.5), ylim = c(39.7, 40.5), expand = FALSE) + 
  theme_void(base_size = 15) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16)
  ) +
  guides(color = guide_colorbar(
    title.position = "top",
    barwidth = 15,
    barheight = 0.5
  )) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "D", name = "Stars") + 
  labs(
    title = "Restaurant Ratings in Southeastern Pennsylvania (By County)",
    color = "Stars"
  )
```

## Rating-Associated Factors
We made an in-depth [Exploratory Analysis](Stars.html) about restaurant rating, and at last we identified the indicators of rating and constructed the model for predicting the restaurants ratings.
